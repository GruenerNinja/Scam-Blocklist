### How domains are added to the blocklist

- The script searches Google with a list of search terms almost exclusively used in scam sites
- Domains are filtered against a whitelist (scam reporting sites, forums, genuine stores, etc.), along with other filtering
- Domains are compared against the Cisco Umbrella Toplist
- Domains found in the toplist are checked manually
- Dead domains are removed
- Resolving `www` subdomains are included in the domains list
- Domains that are found in toplist/whitelist updates are vetted manually

Malicious domains found in [r/Scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams) are also added after being manually vetted.

To see the full filtering process check out the code in the repository.

### Inspiration

After browsing r/Scams for weeks and manually reporting scam sites to Hagezi's issue tracker, I realised most scam sites follow a similar template.

There is no way I could not keep up with the amount of scam sites created daily but with this project I aim to retrieve as many newly created scam sites as possible.
