# Jarelllama's Scam Blocklist

Blocklist for newly created scam, phishing, and malware domains automatically retrieved daily using Google Search API, automated detection, and public databases.

Since the project began, the blocklist has expanded to include not only scam websites but also malware domains.

This blocklist aims to be an alternative to blocking all newly registered domains (NRDs) seeing how many, but not all, NRDs are malicious. This is done by detecting new malicious domains within a short period of their registration date.

For blocking all NRDs, use [xRuffKez's NRD Lists](https://github.com/xRuffKez/NRD).

Sources include:

- Public databases
- Google Search indexing to find common scam site templates
- Detection of common cybersquatting techniques like typosquatting, doppelganger domains, and IDN homograph attacks using [dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist) and [URLCrazy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/urlcrazy)
- Domain generation algorithm (DGA) domain detection using [DGA Detector](https://github.com/exp0se/dga_detector)
- Regex expression matching for phishing NRDs. See the list of expressions [here](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/config/phishing_targets.csv)

A list of all sources can be found in [SOURCES.md](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/SOURCES.md).

The automated retrieval is done daily at 16:00 UTC.

## Automated filtering process

- Domains are filtered against an actively maintained whitelist
- Domains are checked against the [Tranco Top Sites Ranking](https://tranco-list.eu/) for potential false positives which are then vetted manually
- Common subdomains like 'www' are stripped
- Non-domain entries are removed
- Redundant rules are removed via wildcard matching. For example, 'abc.example.com' is a wildcard match of 'example.com' and, therefore, is redundant and removed. Wildcards are occasionally added to the blocklist manually to further optimize the number of entries

Entries that require manual verification/intervention are notified to the maintainer for fast remediations.

The full filtering process can be viewed in the repository's code.

### Dead domains

Dead domains are removed daily using AdGuard's [Dead Domains Linter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DeadDomainsLinter).

Dead domains that are resolving again are included back into the blocklist.

### Parked domains

Parked domains are removed weekly while unparked domains are added back daily. A list of common parked domain messages is used to automatically detect parked domains. This list can be viewed here: [parked_terms.txt](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/config/parked_terms.txt).

Parked sites no longer containing any of the parked messages are assumed to be unparked.

## Other blocklists

### Light version

For collated blocklists cautious about size, a light version of the blocklist is available in the [lists](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/tree/main/lists) directory. Sources excluded from the light version are marked in [SOURCES.md](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/).

Note that dead and parked domains that become alive/unparked are not added back into the light version due to limitations in how these domains are recorded.

### NSFW Blocklist

A blocklist for NSFW domains is available in Adblock Plus format here:
[nsfw.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/main/lists/adblock/nsfw.txt).

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

<li>Domains are automatically retrieved from the Tranco Top Sites Ranking daily</li>
<li>Dead domains are removed daily</li>
<li>Note that resurrected domains are not added back</li>
<li>Note that parked domains are not checked for</li>
</ul>
Total domains: 12765

This blocklist does not just include adult videos, but also NSFW content of the artistic variety (rule34, illustrations, etc).

### Parked domains

For list maintainers interested in using the parked domains as a source, the list of parked domains can be found here: [parked_domains.txt](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/data/parked_domains.txt). This list is capped at 50,000 domains.
