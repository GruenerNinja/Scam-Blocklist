### How the list is formed

- The script searches Google with a list of search terms almost exclusively used in scam sites
- Domains are extracted
- Unique domains are added to the blocklist
- The blocklist is check against a whitelist (scam reporting sites, forums, genuine stores, etc.)
- The final list is compared against the Umbrella Toplist
- Domains found in the toplist are checked manually

### Goal

Identify newly created scam sites that use the same template as reported scam sites.
