## Retrieving scam domains from Google Search
Google provides a [Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) to retrieve JSON-formatted results from Google Search. The script uses a list of search terms almost exclusively used in scam sites to retrieve domains. See the list of search terms here: [search_terms.csv](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/config/search_terms.csv)

#### Rationale
Scam sites often do not have a long lifespan; malicious domains may be replaced before they can be manually reported. By programmatically searching Google using paragraphs from real-world scam sites, new domains can be added as soon as Google crawls the site. This requires no manual reporting.

The list of search terms is proactively updated and is mostly sourced from investigating new scam site templates seen on r/Scams.

#### Limitations
The Google Custom Search JSON API only provides ~100 free search queries per day. This limits the number of search terms that can be employed a day.

To optimise the number of queries made, each search term is frequently benchmarked on their number of new domains and false positives. The figures for each search term can be viewed here: [source_log.csv](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/config/source_log.csv)

> Queries made today: 108 (rate limited)

#### Regarding other sources
The full domain retrieval process for all sources can be viewed in the repository's code.

## Filtering process
- The domains collated from all sources are filtered against a whitelist (scam reporting sites, forums, vetted companies, etc.)
- The domains are checked against the [Tranco Top Sites Ranking](https://tranco-list.eu/) for potential false positives and flagged domains are vetted manually
- Redundant entries are removed via wildcard matching. For example, 'sub.spam.com' is a wildcard match of 'spam.com' and is, therefore, redundant and is removed. Many of these wildcard domains also happen to be malicious hosting sites
- Only domains are included in the blocklist. IP addresss are checked for resolving DNS records and URLs are stripped down to their domains

The full filtering process can be viewed in the repository's code.

## Dead domains
Dead domains are removed daily using [AdGuard's Dead Domains Linter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DeadDomainsLinter). Note that domains acting as wildcards are excluded from this process. Dead domains that have become alive again are included back into the blocklist. This check for resurrected domains is also done daily.

## Why the Hosts format is not supported
Malicious domains often have [wildcard DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/wildcard-dns-records/) that allow scammers to create large amounts of subdomain records, such as 'long-random-subdomain.scam.com'. To collate individual subdomains would be difficult and would inflate the blocklist size. Therefore, only formats supporting wildcard matching are built.

Additionally, wildcard domains are periodically added manually to the blocklist to reduce the number of entries via wildcard matching.
