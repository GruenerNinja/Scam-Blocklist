### How domains are added to the blocklist

- The script searches Google with a list of search terms almost exclusively used in scam sites. See the list of search terms here: [search_terms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/main/search_terms.txt)
- Domains are filtered against a whitelist (scam reporting sites, forums, genuine stores, etc.), along with other filtering
- Domains found in the Cisco Umbrella 1M toplist are checked manually
- Resolving subdomains are included in the domains list. See the list of subdomains checked here: [subdomains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/main/data/subdomains.txt)
- Domains found in toplist/whitelist updates are vetted manually

Malicious domains found in [r/Scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams) are occasionally added after being manually vetted.

Domains are retrieved from multiple regions such as Asia, Europe and North America.

To see the full filtering and retrieval process check out the code in the repository.

### Dead domains

Dead domains are removed during the domain retrieval process and once a day for the full blocklist. Dead domains that resolve again are added back.

### Inspiration

After browsing r/Scams for weeks and manually reporting scam sites to Hagezi's issue tracker, I realised most scam sites follow a similar template.

There is no way I can keep up with the number of scam sites created daily but with this project, I aim to retrieve as many newly created scam sites as possible.
