## Retrieving scam domains from Google Search

Google provides a [Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) to retrieve JSON-formatted results from Google Search. The script uses a list of search terms almost exclusively used in scam sites to retrieve results, of which the domains are added to the blocklist. These search terms are manually added while investigating scam sites. See the list of search terms here: [search_terms.csv](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/config/search_terms.csv)

#### Why this method is effective

Scam sites often do not have a long lifespan; domains can be created and removed within the same month. By searching Google Search using paragraphs of real-world scam sites, new domains can be added as soon as Google crawls the site. The search terms are often taken from sites reported on r/Scams, where real users are encountering these sites in the wild.

#### Limitations

The Google Custom Search JSON API only provides 100 free search queries per day. Because of the number of search terms used, the Google Search source can only be employed once a day, otherwise, subsequent runs might return with 0 domains.

#### Regarding other sources

The full domain retrieval process for all sources can be viewed in the repository's code.

## Filtering process

- The domains collated from all sources are filtered against a whitelist (scam reporting sites, forums, vetted companies, etc.), along with other filtering
- The domains are checked against the [Tranco 1M Toplist](https://tranco-list.eu/) for potential false positives and flagged domains are vetted manually
- Redundant entries are removed via wildcard matching. For example, 'sub.spam.com' is a wildcard match of 'spam.com' and is, therefore, redundant and is removed. Many of these wildcard domains also happen to be malicious hosting sites

The full filtering process can be viewed in the repository's code.

## Dead domains

Dead domains are removed daily using [AdGuard's Dead Domains Linter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DeadDomainsLinter). Note that domains acting as wildcards are excluded from this process.

Dead domains that have become alive again are added back into the blocklist. This check for resurrected domains is also done daily.

## Why the Hosts format is not supported

Malicious domains often have [wildcard DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/wildcard-dns-records/) that allow scammers to create large amounts of subdomain records, such as 'long-random-subdomain.scam.com'. To collate individual subdomains would be a difficult task and would inflate the blocklist size. Therefore, only formats supporting wildcard matching are built.

## Malicious hosting sites

Some wildcard domains are added manually to the blocklist to reduce the number of entries via wildcard matching. Many of these wildcard domains are discovered to be malicious hosting sites with multiple subdomains pointing to scam sites. These malicious hosting sites are included in the blocklist and can be found among the wildcard domains in [wildcards.txt](https://github.com/jarelllama/Scam-Blocklist/blob/main/data/wildcards.txt).
